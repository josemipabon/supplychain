Welcome to the PowerShell GitHub Community! PowerShell is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models. It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language, and a framework for processing cmdlets.

Windows PowerShell vs. PowerShell 7+
Although this repository started as a fork of the Windows PowerShell codebase, changes made in this repository are not ported back to Windows PowerShell 5.1. This also means that issues tracked here are only for PowerShell 7.x and higher. Windows PowerShell specific issues should be reported with the Feedback Hub app, by choosing "Apps > PowerShell" in the category.
